## Description

Hello and thank you for your time reading this. This program is kind of like a project used to test my understanding so far in the javascript.

So to understand, this application is a simple app that is used for viewing the place that the user share like a social app. Where we can change avatar image, user name and job, and also upload image that we like to the server to show the other about it. With the card we can view it in enlarged image and also getting like for the image that we posted.

The technology used is HTML 5, CSS 3 and javaScript.

This application is far from perfect, though i still trying to strive toward my goal to make this app more user friendly and safe and also able to be expanded as much as it able to.

## How to Operate the App

When you first load the interface you will be shown a profile section, which comprised of editable avatar image, name and job.

And then next to it you can add a caption and an image url for showing what you like to the server.

Below that we can see the generated card that shows every image and like count that is recorded in the server. And of course you can enlarge the image to better view it by clicking on the card image, and last but not least you can add like to the image.
